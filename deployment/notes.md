Deciding to use Vertex AI Deployment

## According to ChatGPT: Seldon deployment
To deploy your model using Seldon, you can follow these general steps:

Create a Seldon deployment file: Create a YAML file that describes the configuration of your Seldon deployment, including the model to be used, the container image to be used, and any other relevant parameters. You can find more information about the structure of the deployment file in the Seldon documentation.

Upload your model to a container registry: Before deploying your model, you need to create a container image that contains the model and any necessary dependencies. You can use a tool like Docker to create the container image and then upload it to a container registry such as Docker Hub or Google Container Registry.

Deploy your model using Seldon: Once you have your deployment file and container image ready, you can use the Seldon CLI to deploy your model. You can do this by running the following command:

```bash
seldon deploy <deployment-name> --namespace <namespace> --predictor-type tensorflow --model-image <container-image-url> --oauth
```
Replace <deployment-name> with the name you want to give to your deployment, <namespace> with the Kubernetes namespace where you want to deploy the model, and <container-image-url> with the URL of the container image you uploaded in step 2. The --oauth flag is used to enable authentication for the API endpoint.

Test your deployment: Once your deployment is up and running, you can test it by sending requests to the API endpoint. You can use the seldon-core-tester tool to send sample requests and check the responses.
Note that the exact steps may vary depending on the specifics of your model and deployment environment. You can find more information in the Seldon documentation and the Kubernetes documentation.
